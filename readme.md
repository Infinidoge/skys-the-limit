# The Sky's The Limit
## Made for ModFest 1.20

They always say "The sky's the limit!", but clearly the sky isn't limiting enough.
To fix this, I put a ceiling on the Overworld!

A ceiling of transparent sky blocks is generated at Y=300. These blocks are mineable (if somewhat slowly), and blast resistant like obsidian.
